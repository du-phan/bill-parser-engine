    Output model for text reconstruction with FOCUSED REFERENCE RESOLUTION support.
    
    STEP 1 IMPLEMENTATION: This model implements the focused output data contract
    that enables the 30x+ performance improvement in reference location processing.
    
    FOCUSED REFERENCE RESOLUTION APPROACH:
    =====================================
    
    Traditional Problem:
    - Mixed all changes together in single field
    - Downstream components scanned entire article text (3000+ chars)
    - Wasted computational resources on unchanged text
    - Slower processing and higher API costs
    
    Focused Solution:
    - Separates deleted_or_replaced_text from newly_inserted_text
    - Enables scanning only changed fragments (~80 chars)
    - Provides 30x+ performance improvement
    - Maintains accuracy while dramatically reducing processing time
    
    THREE-FIELD ARCHITECTURE:
    ========================
    
    1. deleted_or_replaced_text: Text that was removed or replaced
       → Contains DELETIONAL references (references being removed from law)
       → Used by ReferenceLocator for focused scanning of removed content
       → Enables proper context for object linking (original law context)
       
    2. newly_inserted_text: Text that was added or inserted
       → Contains DEFINITIONAL references (references being added to law)  
       → Used by ReferenceLocator for focused scanning of new content
       → Enables proper context for object linking (amended text context)
       
    3. intermediate_after_state_text: Complete article after all changes
       → Preserved for context and other downstream needs
       → NOT used for reference scanning (would defeat the performance gains)
       → Available for final validation and full-text operations
    
    REFERENCE CLASSIFICATION IMPACT:
    ===============================
    This separation enables proper classification of references by source type:
    
    - DELETIONAL references: Found in deleted_or_replaced_text
      → Need original law context for proper object linking
      → Represent legal citations being removed from legislation
      
    - DEFINITIONAL references: Found in newly_inserted_text
      → Need amended text context for proper object linking  
      → Represent legal citations being added to legislation
      
    Different reference types require different contextual analysis in downstream
    components, making this separation crucial for accuracy.
    
    PERFORMANCE BENEFITS:
    ====================
    - 30x+ speed improvement in reference location
    - Reduced API costs (fewer tokens processed)
    - Maintained reference detection accuracy
    - Enables real-time legislative processing
    - Scales efficiently to large legislative documents
    
    PIPELINE INTEGRATION:
    ====================
    - Generated by LegalAmendmentReconstructor (Step 4)
    - Consumed by ReferenceLocator for focused scanning (Step 5)
    - Enables the entire focused reference resolution approach
    - Maintains backward compatibility with existing pipeline components
